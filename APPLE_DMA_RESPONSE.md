Dear App Review Team,

We are writing to formally contest the rejection of our application under Guideline 3.1.1 regarding In-App Purchase requirements.

## IMPORTANT: This is our 5th submission attempt

We want to emphasize that **this is already our FIFTH attempt** to get our application approved. We have invested significant time, resources, and money into this process - including Apple Developer Program fees, development costs, legal consultations, and countless hours of work addressing each review feedback.

Despite our best efforts to comply with all guidelines, we continue to face rejection on grounds that we believe are **inconsistent with European Union law**. This situation is causing substantial financial harm to our small business and preventing us from serving our customers on the iOS platform.

We respectfully request that this submission be reviewed with careful consideration of the legal arguments presented below.

## Legal Basis: Digital Markets Act (DMA) - Regulation (EU) 2022/1925

Our application is developed and operated by a company established in **Poland, European Union**. As such, we are entitled to the protections and rights granted under the **Digital Markets Act (DMA)**, which came into full effect on **March 6, 2024**.

### Key DMA Provisions Applicable to This Case:

**Article 5(4) of the DMA** explicitly prohibits gatekeepers (including Apple) from:

> "requiring business users to use, offer or interoperate with an identification service, a web browser engine or a payment service, or technical services that support the provision of payment services, such as payment systems for in-app purchases, of that gatekeeper in the context of services offered by the business users using that gatekeeper's core platform services"

**Article 5(7) of the DMA** further states that gatekeepers shall:

> "allow providers of services and providers of hardware, free of charge, effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the same hardware and software features accessed or controlled via the operating system or virtual assistant"

### European Commission Designation

On **September 6, 2023**, the European Commission designated Apple as a "gatekeeper" under the DMA for the following core platform services:
- iOS (operating system)
- App Store (app distribution platform)
- Safari (web browser)

This designation was confirmed and Apple was required to comply with all DMA obligations by **March 6, 2024**.

### Our Rights Under DMA

As a European Union-based business user of the App Store, we have the legal right to:

1. **Use alternative payment systems** - We are not obligated to use Apple's In-App Purchase system for digital goods and services
2. **Link to external payment options** - We may inform users about alternative purchasing options outside the app
3. **Offer subscriptions through our website** - Users may purchase subscriptions via our website (rezerwacja24.pl) using payment processors of our choice (Stripe)
4. **Communicate pricing information** - We may display pricing and subscription information within our app

### Application Details

**Rezerwacja24** is a B2B SaaS (Software as a Service) application for business owners in the beauty, wellness, and service industries. Our business model:

- Users create accounts and purchase subscriptions through our website: **https://rezerwacja24.pl**
- Payment processing is handled by **Stripe**, a licensed payment service provider in the EU
- The iOS application serves as a companion tool for existing subscribers to manage their business operations
- This model is identical to other B2B SaaS applications available on the App Store (Calendly, Acuity Scheduling, Square Appointments, Notion, Slack, etc.)

### European Commission Enforcement Actions

We note that the European Commission has already initiated proceedings against Apple for DMA non-compliance:

- **June 24, 2024**: Commission issued preliminary findings that Apple's App Store rules breach DMA
- **Ongoing investigations**: Multiple proceedings regarding Apple's compliance with Articles 5 and 6 of DMA

The Commission has stated:

> "Apple's rules prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content"

### Our Position

We respectfully but firmly assert that:

1. **Requiring In-App Purchase is illegal under EU law** - The DMA explicitly prohibits this requirement for EU-based developers
2. **We will not implement In-App Purchase** - We exercise our legal right under DMA to use alternative payment systems
3. **Our current implementation is compliant** - Offering subscriptions through our website with Stripe is fully legal and protected under DMA
4. **Apple must comply with DMA** - Non-compliance exposes Apple to fines of up to 10% of worldwide annual turnover

### Request for Resolution

We request that Apple:

1. **Approve our application** without requiring In-App Purchase implementation
2. **Recognize our DMA rights** as an EU-based developer
3. **Allow external payment links** as mandated by EU law

We are prepared to:
- Provide documentation of our EU business registration
- Cooperate with any reasonable verification process
- Escalate this matter to the European Commission if necessary

### Legal Notice

Should Apple continue to reject our application on these grounds, we reserve the right to:

1. File a formal complaint with the **European Commission** regarding DMA non-compliance
2. Report this matter to the **Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK)**
3. Seek legal remedies available under EU law
4. Participate in any ongoing or future Commission proceedings against Apple

### Conclusion

The Digital Markets Act exists precisely to prevent the kind of anti-competitive behavior that Guideline 3.1.1 represents for EU developers. We are exercising our legal rights under EU law and expect Apple to comply with its obligations as a designated gatekeeper.

We look forward to a prompt resolution of this matter in accordance with applicable EU law.

Sincerely,
